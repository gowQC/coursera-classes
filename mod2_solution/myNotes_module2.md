FIRST ATTEMPT:
DATE: 2/27/23 @12:15AM

My first attempt for this assignment is technically incomplete, but I feel it covers a good deal of what the assingment asked of us. My main struggle is the spacing with 
the title sections for each entree. Everything else seems sufficient except for that. I think revisiting lecture 22 may help me remake the foundation for this project, as
it didn't feel like the cleanest code ever written. I wish I could offer more time, but balancing this course along with a full time job is not easy.  Definitely need to 
revisit lecture 22 to help with spacing and positioning.
